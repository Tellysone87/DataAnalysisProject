<h1>DataAnalysisProject</h1>


<p>Here is a project completed I contributed to during a data engineering bootcamp through Correlation One. I was the team lead and I guided a group of four people. We decided to do a project on safe traveling for women and minorities. I was responsible cleaning one of our data sets and I also created our interactive dashboard. </p>
