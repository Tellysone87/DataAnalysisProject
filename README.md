<h1>DataAnalysisProject</h1>


<p>Here is a project I contributed to during a data engineering bootcamp through Correlation One. I was the team lead and I guided a group of four people. I was responsible for scheduling all team, mentor and teacher assistant meetings. I also had to keep the team motivated and track any hardships. I made sure deliverables were turn in before deadlines. We all were assigned different tasks to ensure that we all contributed. I was responsible for cleaning one of our data sets and I also created our interactive dashboard. I have included a link to the working dashboard and my cleaning code is in the project files.</p>

<p>Here is the just of our project. We decided to do a project on safe traveling for women and minorities. Women are not given the same freedoms when solo traveling and are at a greater risk of gender-based violence when solo traveling locally and internationally. We want to provide a resource that all women can utilize that will share the safest destinations for travel based on various safety factors. These factors were modeled and ranked into 6 indexes (social, LGBTQ+, Race, Women, Resource Access, Safety) per country. This will allow women to feel more secure in their travels. You may review our final presentation below. Safe Traveling!</p>
